try that new frameworky thing that tries to be magic and supports all OSes including Android...

think about how arduino could tell us what its serial capabilities are
ardunioA might have a voltage test it can/should run.
ardunioB might have the voltage test and a radio test.
maybe we just want to run_all_tests() or something...?
or could do it the other way where we send 'run tests\n' and the arduinos do their own thing?
